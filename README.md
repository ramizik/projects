- Full Stack Website
- DORMIFY Website (https://dormstorm.netlify.app/)
Dormify is a full-stack dorm app that compiles college dorm information into one place, allowing users to compare dorms easily and make an informed decision about the dorm they choose. This app is intended to make the entire process of selecting dorms easier for University of the Pacific students.

## Features Implemented
1. **Housing Selection Page**
    - **Dorm Filtering:** the dorms displayed in the housing selection page can be filtered down based on the user's preferences.
        - Can filter based on the following dorm attributes:
            - 1.) Semester rates
            - 2.) Minimum meal plan
            - 3.) Other miscellaneous attributes
    - **Dorm Search Bar:** a user can search for a specific dorm, showing dorms with matching names within the housing selection page.
    - **Dorm View Sorting:** a user can sort the order of the dorms displayed in the housing selection page based on certain criteria.
    - Three Dorm Option Views:
        - 1.) **Gallery View:** each dorm is displayed with its respective image and attributes.
        - 2.) **List View:** each dorm is displayed in text form for concise viewing.
        - 3.) **Map View:** this view is a map that shows where each dorm is on campus. A user can press on a dorm on the map to see more information about it. This is intended to help students better visualize a dorm's location on campus.
2. **Dorm Comparison Page:** a user can select dorms from within the housing selection and compare them from within the comparison page as seen below:
3. **Frequently Asked Question Page (FAQ):** in the case the user has any questions about the housing selection process, they can refer to the FAQ page to see if their question as been answered already.
