# Completed Software Projects
## Project â„–1 - Full Stack Website "Dormstorm"
- Website: https://dormstorm.netlify.app/
Dormstorm is a full-stack dorm app that compiles college dorm information into one place, allowing users to compare dorms easily and make an informed decision about the dorm they choose. This app is intended to make the entire process of selecting dorms easier for University of the Pacific students.

Features Implemented
1. **Housing Selection Page**
    - **Dorm Filtering:** the dorms displayed in the housing selection page can be filtered down based on the user's preferences.
        - Can filter based on the following dorm attributes:
            - 1.) Semester rates
            - 2.) Minimum meal plan
            - 3.) Other miscellaneous attributes
    - **Dorm Search Bar:** a user can search for a specific dorm, showing dorms with matching names within the housing selection page.
    - **Dorm View Sorting:** a user can sort the order of the dorms displayed in the housing selection page based on certain criteria.
    - Three Dorm Option Views:
        - 1.) **Gallery View:** each dorm is displayed with its respective image and attributes.
        - 2.) **List View:** each dorm is displayed in text form for concise viewing.
        - 3.) **Map View:** this view is a map that shows where each dorm is on campus. A user can press on a dorm on the map to see more information about it. This is intended to help students better visualize a dorm's location on campus.
2. **Dorm Comparison Page:** a user can select dorms from within the housing selection and compare them from within the comparison page as seen below:
3. **Frequently Asked Question Page (FAQ):** in the case the user has any questions about the housing selection process, they can refer to the FAQ page to see if their question as been answered already. 
4. **Contact Us Page:** in the case a user has a question that has not been answered yet in the FAQ page or otherwise need to contact the UOP housing department, they can do so in this page.
    - **Email Messaging:** this feature allows a user to send a message with their attached email to the college housing department from within the website itself.

## Project â„–2: "DOOM"-like WebGL FPS video-game

My contribuion:
  - 3D virtual environment in JavaScript;
  - Game Physics: Positional and directional lighting, procedural texturing, shading, player movement, point sprites, and game speed;
  - Game logic and winning condition;

*Note*: To open application, you need to run a local webserver. For example, you can do it using python. Start webserver by typing next command to command line (Make sure that you're in same directory where application is located):
```
 > python -m http.server
```
Then, open web browser and type http://localhost:8000/ in the address bar. Now you can open the mainPage.html to run the application.

My contribution:
  - Object-Oriented Programming in Java;
  - Mouse & Keyboard event handling;
  - Gravity physics & collision detection;
  - GUI & UX;
  - Multiplayer mode & in-game powerups affecting the gameplay expierence;

*Note*: To open the game, you need to use compiler (Preferably Eclipse) and run file named "MainApplication.java" located in
```
src/main/java/TigerGame/
```
 
- ðŸ‘‘ C#/C++ mini projects:
  - Practised and studied different programming concepts in C# and C++.
  - Created problems and implemented learned material in different mini programs-solutions. The program description is commented out in the code.
